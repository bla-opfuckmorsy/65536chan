=========

poorly-written imageboard software

Requirements
============
Mongodb php extension
Imagick php extension (should be fairly recent to avoid a certain bug with animated GIF's)

Directory stuff
===============
All the files go in the www folder, also, the following directories are needed:
www/images/
www/images/thumbs/
www/audio/
Make sure the php scripts can read from / write to these



I created this repo primarily for backup since my laptop's HDD is getting old,
	so it is primarily for my use.

Therefore, USE AT YOUR OWN RISK.  Don't blame me if you fuck something up horribly
	and irreparably while trying to make this work.

About the code: Yes, it is horrible, hacky, and unsophisticated.
	I started this project as a way to learn PHP, so of course it will be that way.
	I'll (maybe) improve it as I learn more about PHP, so it might get better.
	I'm open to suggestions as long as I can learn from them; that's the reason
	I wrote this software in the first place
I intend on adding proper commenting to the code so others might be able to learn from it as well,
	but my habits when it comes to documentation are horrible, so the comments will lag behind / be irrelevant at times.
